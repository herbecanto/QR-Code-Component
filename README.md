## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about how to best position the QR sign, as well as a little bit of flexbox.
In the css part, i learned how to put the footer in the botom:

```css
footer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

and i learn that i need to put all the font weight in my link that i need to put in my style.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@300;400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about web design, especially with JavaScript, and, on the other hand, perfect my knowledge with flexbox and grid.
